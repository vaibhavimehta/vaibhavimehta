- 👋 Hi, I’m Vaibhavi Mehta (@vaibhavimehta)
- 🎓 I am a Graduate Student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, currently pursuing my Master of Science degree in Information Management.
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Visualization, Data Analytics, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Technical Consulting.
- 💻 I’m currently learning R and Python. I have worked as a Data Analyst (Research Assistant) for The World Health Organization (WHO) at the Center for Health Informatics at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My project is aimed at preventing the spread of Covid-19 misinformation present in the world on the web.
- 🎥 I have also trained scholars across United States (focusing on Historically Black Colleges and Universities) in several digital publishing platforms as a Graduate Technical Assistant at the University Library, for which I learnt Adobe Premiere Pro and the publishing tools on my own.
- 🔗 I’m looking to collaborate on unique projects that help address issues affecting different aspects of our society, such as Health, Agriculture, Environment, Humanities, etc.. I am also interested in projects that help improve Business Processes, promote technological advancement, and overall help us communicate better with each other.
